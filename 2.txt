How I Ensure My Frontend Work Is Easy to Maintain for Other Developers

1. Modular & Component-Driven Development
1.1 Break the UI into reusable atomic components (buttons, cards, modals).
1.2 Avoid duplicate code by reusing components across pages.

2. Clear Project Structure
2.1 Follow a consistent folder structure (components/, hooks/, utils/, pages/).
2.2 Helps new developers navigate and locate files quickly.

3. Readable & Consistent Code Style
3.1 Use ESLint + Prettier for formatting.
3.2 Stick to clear naming conventions for variables, functions, and components (e.g., UserCard, BookingForm).

4. State Management Best Practices
4.1 Avoid prop drilling by using Redux or React Context where needed.
4.2 Keep global state minimal and localize state whenever possible.
4.3 Document state structure and actions for easy extension.

5. API Layer Abstraction
5.1 Never call APIs directly inside components.
5.2 Maintain a dedicated services/api.js or custom hooks (useAPI.js) for API calls.
5.3 Makes it easy to swap or update APIs without touching multiple files.

6. Documentation & Comments
6.1 Use JSDoc-style comments for complex functions and hooks.
6.2 Provide README files in important modules for quick onboarding.

7. Testing
7.1 Write unit tests for components.
7.2 Add integration tests for critical user flows (e.g., login, booking, checkout).
7.3 Ensures stability when future developers modify code.

8. Scalable Styling Approach
8.1 Stick to a single styling approach (CSS Modules, TailwindCSS, or styled-components).
8.2 Follow a design system so devs know which styles/components to reuse.

9. Code Reviews & Knowledge Sharing
9.1 Participate in code reviews to maintain consistency and best practices.
9.2 Document architectural decisions in Confluence/Notion so new developers know why a solution was chosen
